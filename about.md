I am currenlty a graduate student at The University of Texas at Dallas who is a beginner to all things coding. I wanted to create this webpage in order to upload all of my past projects from my coursework for my Master's in Social Data Analytics and Research. I want to show my knowledge and abilities in the field of data analytics and the experience that I have in coding. As you can see, the webpage is still pretty bare as it needs more work. Keep checking back to see the progress!

Spring 2020

This course provided a survey of the regression models estimated using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), with an emphasis on using regression models to test hypotheses about social phenomenon. For this course, I was asked to complete a replication and extension of an existing research paper. I chose a paper which investigated the effects of Republican governments on restrictive labor policy. Below I have attached the final paper along with the original code from the exisiting research paper, as well as my replication code.

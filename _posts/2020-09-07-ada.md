Fall 2018

This course introduced the application of data anlaysis techniques needed to perform statistical analysis using social science data by using a statistical software package called STATA. For this course, I chose to invesitgate crime at UTD for my final project. I am not from the Dallas area, and was interested to find out how safe UTD was as a campus. Below I have attached the labs completed in the course, as well as the final project paper, code, and presentation. The code for the labs is typed within each lab document.

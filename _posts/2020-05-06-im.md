Spring 2020

This was my first time using the languages MySQL and Python, the database management servers pgAdmin4 and Falcon SQL Client, and my frist time utilizing Python. I received significant help from Karl Ho, Associate Professor of Instruction at UT Dallas.
This course required a search for a topic of interest for which we would collect, manage, analyze, and interpret in a final paper and presentation. I should mention the last few months of this course were conducted online due to COVID-19.
I chose to collect data regarding the Death Penalty in the United States. Below I have attached the final paper, code and presentation, as well as some tables and graphics produced through the use of the software aforementioned.

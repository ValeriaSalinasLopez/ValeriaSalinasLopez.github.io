title: Advanced Sociological Research
---
Spring 2019

This course introduced advanced sociological research methods used by the scientific community, and how to develop sociologically relevant research questions. For this course, I needed to develop and conduct my own research project. I decided to invesitigate whether there is a relationship between political affiliation/ideology, religiosity, and charity. Below I have attached the final paper and presentation, along with the code for the statistical analysis and graphics within the paper.
